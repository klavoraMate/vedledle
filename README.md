This project marks my initial attempt at creating a complete application that encompasses both frontend and backend development, starting from the ground up. The primary objective of this project is to craft a website dedicated to dog grooming services. Users will be able to sign up on the website along with their furry companions. Once registered, they can navigate to the calendar section to make appointments for grooming sessions. Additionally, the website will feature a welcoming landing page and an image gallery. The frontend of the application is constructed using React, while the backend relies on Java Spring Boot, coupled with a PostgreSql database for data management.


## Tech Stack

**frontend:** React, TS
